                    <p>Working alone in a remote location for up to 198 days at a time requires good planning and the discipline to follow through with those plans. Weather, wildlife, and administrative changes can challenge Lookout Observers to adapt to unplanned events and conditions.  The extreme isolation that comes from being in the woods for so long is only combated by committing oneself to personal development. It was at my first tower that I started learning to code in ActionScript 3.0, and it was at my fire tower where I studied to earn a 4.0 GPA at NAIT. My time in the forest has been a secret weapon that I have used to accomplish my goals during the most successful decade of my life.</p>
                    <p>Certifications required for Wildfire Lookout Observers includes CPR Level C with AED, a Radio Operator’s License, Incident Command System 100, and successful completion of the Lookout Observer Course at the Hinton Training Centre. Lookout Observers are trained in mapping, wildfire detection, radio protocols, wildfire reporting, safety (including interpersonal conflict management), fall arrest systems, weather recording, and the proper use of bear spray.</p>

                    <p>TechCareers was created as a full stack developer bootcamp intended for students who were on employment insurance and interested in trying a new career in technology. The course was originally delivered at Enterprise Square campus but after the outbreak of Covid-19 delivery was moved online. Some course content was available from previous cohorts of the TechCareers program but most content had to be created, tested, delivered, and graded by staff on short turnaround times. The entire course was rewritten in a few short months and delivered to the following two cohorts before provincial cutbacks ended the TechCareers program. Students in this program were incredibly diverse with some students being total beginners to code.</p>
                    <p>I am very proud of my students accomplisments and the hard work my team put into the TechCareers program. My role was initially focused on creating course content and lesson plans but as time went on I took on more administrative duties and also initiated an after-hours homework help program that most students found to be effective. TechCareers challenged my leadership and communication skills while teaching me how to reach the next level of my craft.</p>
